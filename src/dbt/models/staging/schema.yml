    Developed by Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912, it often serves as a gauge of economic inequality, 
    measuring income distribution or, less commonly, wealth distribution among a population.
    
    The co-efficient ranges from 0 (or 0%) to 1 (or 100%), with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality. 
    Values greater than 1 are theoretically possible due to negative income or wealth."
